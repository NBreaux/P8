		For P8 prime we need to edit the header file and add 2 extra parts to c2 table and new sigma table
		and i think thats it. Me and Nick added 2 columns and 2 rows to c1 for < and <=. We haven't touched 
		c2 or newsigma yet or comi table comf not sure what needs to be done  there.
		did add the code for greater then equal in nexts so thats there. - Miguel
