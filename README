So far included are the files P8.h and p8org.c. decided to use these files which look similar as to page 91 in our books. 

Also I havent quite figured it out yet but if you want to discuss something
just post it on wave.
                                
These are all the functions that need to be implemented into the source
TODO:   
		hash ( char *s) - pg 100
		INTSTR( CHAR *t) - pg 103 
		letterstr( char *t) - pg 104
		makename( char *p, char *q, char *r) - pg 105
		outscan ( void ) - pg 109-111
		scan ( void ) - pg 112
		tento (int n) - pg 113

DONE:   
		atold( char *a ) - pg 95  Miguel: looks good Danny .
		initscan( void )  - pg 102 
		illegalch( void ) - pg 101
		extradot ( int d, char *t) pg 98
		delimiter ( void ) - pg 97
		baddigitstr( char *t) - pg 96

Functions that have been implemented but need to be double checked		
CHECK:
		floatstr( char *t) - pg 99
		intstr( char *t) - pg 103 // Please check implementation of the return statement on line 196 of the source.
		nexts ( char *s, char *t) - pg 106-108
